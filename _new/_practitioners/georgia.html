        <h3>Changing the way we speak about sex</h3>
        <p>
            As a Sex Educator and Intimacy Coach, I aim to bring mindfulness to sex with real, practical and useful tools allowing people
            to explore their sensuality. I offer coaching for individuals, couples and groups and help people to meet or reclaim their
            sensual identity. I work behind the scenes in program development and sex tech, releasing an app powered by AI supporting
            couples to have more fulfilling relationships. I have recently come on board as come on board as the Australian Ambassador
            for <a href="https://we-vibe.com/" target="_blank">We-Vibe</a>, an innovative company that designs and manufactures
            world-leading couples and solo vibrators.
        </p>
        <p>
            With training in direct experiential learning, I apply a client-centred approach to educate and support people to become
            more aware of their bodies, sex and sexuality. Informed by embodied therapy, mindfulness and neuroscience, this comprehensive
            support will allow you to explore your potential with an approach that is tailored and most suited to you. I create an open
            and safe space with the opportunity to ask, share, discuss, feel and relate.
