Masturbation not only feels good, it is good for you: it supports stress relief, helps you sleep, boosts your libido,
supports connection with others and oh so much more.

It’s remarkable that solo female pleasure is still taboo considering all the health benefits that come with
masturbation. And these benefits aren’t limited to your sexual health.

As a Sex Educator and Coach I recommend regular self pleasure practices to all women. This homework is often considered
indulgent, too difficult and sometimes daunting. Masturbation should be as normal and accessible as making a cup of tea,
eating lunch or sleeping in on a Sunday.

I understand it isn’t that simple for everyone. Pleasure is a complex multidimensional phenomenon involving both
psychological and emotional components and female pleasure is still not properly understood as there is hardly any
research into the individuality of our orgasms (surprise, surprise!). Even though there’s not a wealth of science on the
subject there is evidence masturbation can improve your wellbeing in various ways as well as being safe, easy, free AND
has absolutely zero negative effects. Nothing bad can come from doing it.

Still not convinced? Read on for why you should go ahead and get off. Take this a gentle reminder or an intro into why
it’s healthy to touch yourself, bust out a toy, or do anything that makes you feel good as a duty of personal care.

### 1. An orgasm-induced endorphin release can put you in a great mood and support connection with others

Orgasm releases the feel-good neurochemicals dopamine and oxytocin, aka the ‘bliss’, ‘cuddle’ and ‘love’ hormones,
that improve your mood, create a natural high, boost your satisfaction and activate the reward circuits in your
brain. Masturbation is a powerful oxytocin-releasing activity and lowers your defenses and makes your trust people
more, strengthens emotional bonds with self and others. People may feel the effects for up to an hour afterwards. So
this not only makes you feel closer to your romantic partners, you may treat strangers better too.

### 2. Creates greater access to pleasure when having sex with others 

Masturbation allows you to explore your body and discover what feels best. It is vital to know and understand how
you can consciously access pleasure in your own body in order for you to discover deeper, greater pleasure with
others. The more you know about your body, the easier it is to communicate with them too. 

### 3. The clitoris is the only organ in the human body that is specifically designed for pleasure

I repeat, the clitoris has only one function: pleasure. A common misconception is that penetration is the main way
to achieve an orgasm but many women require stimulation of the clitoris. The most visible part of this organ is
about the size of a pea with extra-sensitive nerve endings and is located above the urethral opening. From there,
the clitoris actually extends internally in two shafts that sit along either side of the vaginal canal. Research has
recently found that the G spot is part of your clitoral network. This means that when you’re stimulating the G spot,
you’re actually stimulating part of the clitoris, which is much larger than we’re led to believe. Experts may still
be mapping the clitoris in full, but pretty much everyone understands the benefit: pleasure!

### 4. Self pleasure can boost your libido 

The more sex you have, the more sex you'll want to have. This is the same with self pleasure, the more you
masturbate and become comfortable being sexual with your own body, the more you'll want to be sexual with others. I
call this a libido mindset. Libido is a state of being and an aspect of your identity that can grow, transform and
    change. Self pleasure is a part of the process in creating a libido that works for you. 

### 5. Find it hard to sleep? Masturbation can help

There's a reason why you may feel sleepy after those toe-curling climaxes: Orgasms physically and emotionally
relieve tension and exhaust the body, which allow you to fall asleep quicker. Generally people do sleep better after
masturbating, but very often it’s from feeling relaxed and satisfied. Masturbation helps people sleep the same way
reading a book before bed does, you feel calm and relaxed after.

### 6. Masturbating can ease pain, body aches and menstrual cramps
 
Studies have found that during orgasm, people can withstand up to twice as much pain as usual. The brain chemical
serotonin, which can act as an analgesic, dampens the sensation of pain. There's no reason not to masturbate while
on you are bleeding, if it relieves pain, aches or cramps then go for it.

### 7. Fulfill sexual tension and practice self-love 

Women often tell me they experience their most mind blowing orgasms on their own. So if you've chosen not to have
sex with others, you’re single or you simply want to please yourself; masturbation will never break your heart.

### 8. Self pleasure: the kinky stress relief

Orgasmic or sexual pleasure will often require you to be mindful or present in the moment in order to feel the full
potential or your arousal. This supports you in feeling all the sensations in your body, getting out of your head
and into your body. Pleasure, whether it ends in orgasm or not, shifts the focus away from anything that is causing
stress. If it helps you feel more relaxed and gets you into the moment why not have fun with it?

### 9. Pleasure is now accessible with an endless array of gadgets, toys and accessories to explore

From hands-free vibrators to the much loved rabbit, there is something to please everybody and pleasure is becoming
more accessible than ever before with variety in items, online shopping options and discreet packaging. 

### 10. It feels good
    
Pleasure is good for you, enough said.


Pleasure is such an individual experience, so you may feel these benefits differently and that is completely normal and
expected. The more you explore your body with patience, openness and curiosity, the more you will learn about your
pleasure potential. It’s time to rid ourselves of the taboos and uncertainty and start to celebrate our bodies, in the
name of health!
