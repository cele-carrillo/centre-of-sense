    title: How we work
    text: "At the Centre of Sense, we offer both individual and group experiences, with a focus on self inquiry, interactive exercises, mindful engagements, playful release and expression.

  intention:
    title: A client led approach
    text: "So each experience is tailored and accessible to every person allowing the individual to participate as much or as little as is useful. We understand that everyone will show up differently we respect how they want to engage In Yogestalt there is a permanent intention to withdraw from the preconceived ideas in order to begin a journey of self-discovery, becoming aware of the opposing aspects that make us who we are and which give rise to the turmoil of our  consciousness. Yogestalt proposes various ways of practicing so as to identify these opposites, as well as the tension between. Once this tension becomes obvious, how to respond to it appears organically. This organic response would be similar to when it itches and we scratch, or when we feel thirsty and drink water, so as to satisfy our need in a spontaneous and not speculative manner."
