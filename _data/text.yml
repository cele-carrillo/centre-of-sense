    sound healing, intuitive touch, mindfulness and movement. For so long we have felt the benefits of attending to
    the mind, the Centre of Sense focuses on the integration of the body in the experience.

  rolfing:
    title: Rolfing® - Holistic Bodywork
    subtitle: Well-being, alignment and balance
    description:
    - >
      Rolfing is a technique of soft tissue manipulation, body awareness and movement education aimed at the release and
      realignment of the body, and the reduction of muscular and physical tension and pain. Over a course of sessions, a
      Rolfer addresses the entire fascia network of the body while taking the whole body into account, including
      structural and functional relationships. The practice uses gravity as an ally, which is what sets it apart from
      other types of body work.
    - >
      Rolfing can help athletes, dancers, actors, musicians, yoga and martial arts practitioners, or anyone wishing to
      improve their body awareness and physical performance. As well as people of all ages with histories of pain and
      discomfort, and anyone hoping to rediscover freedom and ease of movement.
    - >
      Rolfing works, because it initiates structural changes that restore the entire body to a more natural order. The
      body's inherent capacity to adapt relaxes, corrects and integrates misalignments and imbalances. This allows
      posture and movement patterns to adjust towards their most efficient and at-ease form, freeing restrictions,
      alleviating pain, and building a foundation for lasting and sustainable results. Moreover, as the body changes
      physically, significant shifts in perception occur as well, resulting in lowered stress and anxiety, increased
      confidence and maturing emotional expression.

  embodied-counselling:
    title: Embodied Counselling
    subtitle: A journey of self inquiry
    description:
    - >
      An Embodied Counselling session allows you to engage mental, emotional, physical and/or biological functions in
      order to bring optimal well-being and healing. Sessions integrate non-dualistic philosophy, embodiment practices,
      humanistic psychology, Mind-Body Medicine techniques and somatic body-work therapies.
    - >
      Embodied Counselling enables us to embody new skills, new competencies, and new ways of being that are relevant to
      our current commitments and the present vision we have of our life. These practices help develop a “new shape”
      that allows us to be more present, open, and connected. Without grounded, sincere practices our intentions for
      change will only be good ideas. Committed practices help us to lever our resilience, develop more choice, respond
      instead of react, and be centred in stressful situations.
    - >
      You are welcomed into each session with a practice of mindfulness to slow down, tune in and be present. We then
      identify what you'd like to work on, which could range from physical tension, emotional responses or a pattern of
      behaviour you've seen come up in your life.
    - >
      By listening to your body, you begin to observe and deepen your understanding of how the present experience is
      organised, your beliefs around it and your physical and emotional response. Ultimately this facilitates:
      self-awareness, boundaries, self-esteem, emotional regulation, empathy, enhanced cognitive processing, easeful
      decision making of complex situations, body related self confidence, a greater sense of self-control, enhanced
      intuition, and a feeling of being both authentic and interconnected with others and the environment.
    - >
      If you're interested in improving your mind-body connection, expand your body awareness or seek a deeper
      understanding into your emotions, Embodied counselling is for you.
