We’re in a time that companies are investing in the health and wellbeing of their employees, however, the current offerings miss the mark, fall short, waste time, effort and money. The Centre of Sense provides useful, skills based, practical & accessible tools. Our goal is to support people and enable them to respond in more organic ways in and out the office.
    The sessions are informed to address: physical tension, stress, mood disorders, disconnection to body and others, sense of isolation, lack of meaning and purpose, enthusiasm, motivation and drive "
